PKI Consortium established PKI Maturity Model Working Group to build a PKI maturity model that will be recognized around the globe as a standard for evaluation, planning, and comparison between different PKI implementations.

## What is PKI maturity model?

Maturity model measures the capability and ability of an organization or implementation for the continuous improvement and evolution in specific area. The PKI maturity model focuses on the specifics of the public key infrastructure implementation and helps to identify the maturity and improvements that can be made. 

## Why we are building the model?

There is currently no standardized and globally recognized maturity model for PKI. Some available models are very specific and built on top of frameworks like Capability Maturity Model Integration ([CMMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration)), working for specific purposes of the consulting companies.

Our goal is to build a PKI maturity model that will be recognized around the globe as a standard for evaluation, planning, and comparison between different PKI implementations. It can also serve as a basis for additional services connected with the model, like PKI maturity assessment, or implementation and action plans definition for PKI environments.

The PKI maturity model should provide the following:

- Quickly understand the current level of capabilities and performance of the PKI
- Support comparison of PKI maturity with similar organizations based on size or industry
- Improvement strategy for the current PKI state
- Improve overall PKI performance and ability to meet the requirements of the industry

## Available resources and contribution

Anyone is more than welcome to contribute to the PKI maturity model. The model is open and available for anyone to use.

The following public resource are available:

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PKI MM working group charter](https://pkic.org/wg/pkimm/charter) | PKI Maturity Model Working Group Charter describing our objectives and activities |
| [PKI MM on GitHub](https://github.com/pkic/pkimm) | Primary repository for the model. You can find here the current documentation of the model, assessment methodology, and other. |
| [PKI MM discussions](https://github.com/pkic/community/discussions/categories/pki-maturity-model-pkimm) | Discussion forum for the PKI maturity model, open to anyone, if you would like to start discussion or just ask a question related to the model. |

The PKI maturity model should server all of us as a standard for the PKI assessment and improvement. It is therefore important for the PKI Consortium to make the model available and accessible for everyone, and establish a community of people who are interested in the model. Continuous improvement is the key to the success of the PKI maturity model.
