## Call for Presentations

We are now accepting proposals for presentations the next Post-Quantum Cryptography Conference of the PKI Consortium, taking place in Europe after the summer of 2023. 

We're looking for speakers to share their expertise on a variety of topics related to Post-Quantum Cryptography. 
- Speakers are expected to be physically present at the conference.
- Speakers are prohibited to promote their products or services.
- All sessions will live streamed, recorded and be publicly available.

Please [submit your proposal](https://forms.gle/Eez13Ubmrp1zFfre9). We will review all proposals and notify selected speakers as soon as possible. 

If you have any questions, please contact us at feedback@pkic.org. 

Thank you for your interest and we look forward to hearing from you!
