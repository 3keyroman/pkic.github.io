**San Francisco, CA. &ndash; February 14, 2013 &ndash;** Leading global certificate authorities announced the creation of the Certificate Authority Security Council (CASC), an advocacy group, committed to the exploration and promotion of best practices that advance the security of websites and online transactions. Through public education, collaboration, and advocacy, the CASC strives to improve understanding of critical policies and their potential impact on the internet infrastructure. Members of the CASC include Comodo, DigiCert, Entrust, GlobalSign, Go Daddy, Symantec, and Trend Micro.

Amid increasing threats from sophisticated hacker networks, global cybercriminal organizations and state-sponsored espionage, the CASC is coming together to promote advanced security standards, encourage best practices, and ultimately improve the deployment of a continually trustworthy SSL ecosystem. In addition, the CASC supports the efforts of the CA/Browser Forum and other standards-setting bodies in their important work, and will continue to help develop reasonable and practical enhancements that improve trusted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and certificate authority (CA) operations.

Coinciding with its launch, the CASC is announcing the first of a planned series of educational and advocacy efforts related to best practices in SSL deployment with a focus on the importance of online certificate status checking and revocation. Specifically, the CASC will highlight the benefits of online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling for Web server administrators, software vendors, browser developers, and end-users through blog posts, conference presentations and other resources.

The backbone of Internet security for nearly two decades, the SSL protocol and certificates from publicly trusted CAs remain the most proven, reliable and scalable method to protect Internet transactions. The CASC is focused on promoting tightened global standards to mitigate high-profile security incidents, and improving research and collaboration that will continue to establish the security-robustness of the SSL ecosystem.
