---
We are excited to have members of the CASC attending and speaking at this year’s RSA Conference. The events and panels will cover various topics that revolve around the security of the Internet and CAs as a whole. You can follow the CASC on Twitter for more information and news at [@CertCouncil](http://bit.ly/X3x9XB), as well as see some of the presentations after the events on our [SlideShare](http://slidesha.re/Ye2dFf) page. Please join us for the following CASC member events:

 

__Tuesday, February 26, 2013, 2:30-3:30 PM, Room 304__  
## TECH-T18 – Alternatives to Certification Authorities for a Secure Web
 **Moderator(s):**  
_CASC Member_– Kirk Hall – Operations Director, Trust Services, Trend Micro, Inc.

###  Panelist(s):
Adam Langley – Senior Staff Software Engineer, Google  
_CASC Member_-Wayne Thayer – Chief Technology Officer, Go Daddy  
_CASC Member_-Quentin Liu – Senior Director Engineering, Symantec  
Yngve Pettersen – Software Developer, Security Specialist

Recent Certification Authority (CA) breaches have created interest in alternatives for a secure web, including DANE, Convergence and other concepts. This panel of browser and CA experts will examine recent CA breaches and remedies, and analyze the most promising alternatives to commercial CAs and their digital certificates. Do these alternatives provide security equivalent to CAs?

 

__Wednesday, February 27, 2013, 8:00-9:00 AM, Room 131__  
## PNG-W21 – NSTIC Report–Path from Cyber-Identity Puzzle to Interoperable ID Ecosystem

Brett McDowell – Senior Manager, Ecosystem Security, PayPal  
Jeremy Grant – Senior Executive Advisor, Identity Management, NIST (US Commerce Department)

Key leaders of the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group and the NSTIC National Program Office will discuss their plans and recent efforts to solve the perplexing cyber identity puzzle, including how they are spearheading the launch of an interoperable ID ecosystem that is secure, cost-effective, voluntary and privacy-enhancing and how trusted identity can meet the needs of traditional IT security.

The recent Stuxnet, Flame and CA compromises involving Comodo and DigiNotar had three common elements—each was government sponsored, each involved Iran and all three involved a PKI compromise. Find out about this type of attack from someone who has been on the receiving end and how to plan to respond to, mitigate and deter such attacks.
