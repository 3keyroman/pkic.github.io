Recent Certification Authority (CA) breaches have created interest in alternatives for a secure web, including DANE, Convergence and other concepts. This panel of browser and CA experts will examine recent CA breaches and remedies, and analyze the most promising alternatives to commercial CAs and their digital certificates. Do these alternatives provide security equivalent to CAs?
