## Introduction

The Training and Certification Working Group (TCWG) unites professionals and organizations dedicated to advancing knowledge and skills in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Recognizing the critical role that PKI plays in securing digital communications and transactions, this working group aims to make PKI knowledge more accessible and to provide structured paths for individuals and organizations to validate their expertise.

Our primary focus is on developing high-quality training materials and certification programs that address the diverse needs of the PKI community. By fostering a collaborative environment, the TCWG encourages the sharing of best practices, innovative strategies, and emerging trends in PKI. This collaboration not only enhances the skills of individual practitioners but also strengthens the overall security posture of organizations implementing PKI solutions.

Training is a key component of our mission. We strive to identify or create comprehensive, up-to-date training materials that cover both fundamental concepts and advanced topics in PKI. These materials are designed to be accessible to a wide audience, from beginners to experienced professionals, ensuring that everyone can benefit from a solid understanding of PKI principles and practices.

Certification is the second pillar of our mission. In a rapidly evolving field like PKI, it is crucial for professionals to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through recognized credentials. The TCWG aims to foster the development and administration of certification programs that provide a reliable measure of an individual’s PKI proficiency. These certifications will help organizations identify qualified candidates and support career development for PKI professionals.

By bringing together experts and stakeholders from various sectors, the TCWG will serve as a central hub for PKI training and certification. Through our efforts, we hope to elevate the standards of PKI practice, promote widespread adoption of robust security measures, and ultimately contribute to the resilience and trustworthiness of the global digital infrastructure.

## Scope
