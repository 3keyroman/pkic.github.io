      title: A quantum cybersecurity agenda for Europe
      description: |
        The rapid development of quantum computing creates a new set of challenges for European cybersecurity. In recent years, the European Union has pursued an ambitious cybersecurity agenda but nevertheless, there are still questions about the current framework’s fitness to respond to these new challenges. Particularly worrisome is the advent of quantum attacks on encryption that risk rendering current cryptographic systems obsolete as they are in use. In July 2023, the European Policy Centre, with the support of Quantum Delta NL, published a discussion paper in which it analyses the criticality of preparing for quantum attacks on encryption by the creation of a new quantum cybersecurity agenda that improves technical and political coordination between EU member states and EU bodies and institutions for the transition to post-quantum cryptography and the future use of other quantum-safe technologies.

        The European Policy Centre (EPC) is an independent, not-for-profit think tank dedicated to fostering European integration through analysis and debate, supporting and challenging decision-makers at all levels to make informed decisions based on evidence and analysis, and providing a platform for engaging partners, stakeholders and citizens in EU policy-making and in the debate about the future of Europe.

      title: What is it going to take to break cryptography with a quantum computer?
      description: |
        The whole industry is working on standardizing and implementing post-quantum cryptography, in order to mitigate the risk from future quantum computers. One question that is (and will probably remain) unanswered is “when are quantum computers going to be powerful enough to break cryptography?”. At the same time, there are regular press releases about new methods of breaking cryptography in the short term. These publications often cause panic and confusion which is counter-productive to the process of mitigating the quantum risk.
        
        In this presentation we give a high-level description on how quantum algorithms work, and what still needs to happen before such algorithms can be implemented on real hardware. A simple model can be used to make sense of past and future announcements on the nearing moment of the cryptopocalypse (the point at which quantum computing becomes powerful enough to use Shor's algorithm to crack public-key cryptography). We discuss some of the examples from the past year.

While the guidance on which PQC standards to adopt is getting clearer, many institutions like ANSSI and BSI recommend hybrid, or multi-key mechanisms for the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, typically combing a classical with a quantum-safe scheme to benefit from the security of both. The question how to perform multi-key exchange and multi-signature schemes (MKE/MSS) lead to several proposals for the integration in protocols like TLS, IPsec and X.509 certificates.

            An implementer of a cryptographic protocol can usually rely on a cryptographic library to implement the primitives and algorithms such as for key exchange and authentication. In the case of MKE/MSS this is usually not the case, and it becomes the implementers task to combine multiple schemes. We argue that it is preferable to have a common abstraction for multi-key schemes in the core cryptographic library that can be used by different protocol stacks. To address this challenge, we propose a common software interface, which is usable for various protocol stacks. We focus on MSS and go through scenarios show how to integrate the interface.

      description: |
        We are at a pivotal moment in cybersecurity. Browsers are preparing to (and may already have) enable(d) post-quantum encryption by default to counter the store-now-decrypt-later threat. What once was the subject of futuristic tech demos, will soon become the baseline expectation for security. Encryption is only half the story. Post-quantum certificates are much more challenging to deploy. In this talk, we will take measure of the current state, and the challenges that lay ahead for the public Web and its PKI.

          title: Update from the GSMA Post Quantum Telco Network Task Force
          description: |  
            The GSMA Post Quantum Telco Network Task Force has been dedicated to exploring the implications of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) within the telecommunications space. Our mission extends beyond theoretical discussions, focusing on the tangible impacts on Network Operators and the broader telco supply chain.

            The task force is a collaborative effort involving more than 50 companies representing operators, government and the wider Telco supply chain, including over 20 major network operators globally.

            Earlier this year, we published a comprehensive [Post Quantum Telco Network Impact Assessment Whitepaper](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//PQ.1-Post-Quantum-Telco-Network-Impact-Assessment-Whitepaper-Version1.0.pdf). Building on this groundwork, we are now actively developing Quantum Risk Management guidelines tailored specifically to the telecommunications industry. Additionally, we are crafting best practice guidelines that delve into Telco use cases, with a particular emphasis on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implications.

            In this presentation, we will provide insights into our findings and ongoing initiatives, shedding light on the practical steps being taken to ensure the resilience and security of Telco networks in the age of quantum computing. Our comprehensive approach ensures that the telecommunications industry is well-prepared to face the security challenges and opportunities presented by the quantum era.

      title: Post-quantum crypto integration for enterprise applications
      description: |
        Quantum computing promises to build computers capable of solving complex problems much faster than today's computers. This will benefit to many real-world applications such AI, machine learning, optimization problems, complex financial modelling etc. However, upcoming quantum computers will have a crypto-apocalyptic impact on cybersecurity, as they will allow breaking most public-key encryption algorithms in use today. Many applications rely on these encryption algorithms to ensure the security of our sensitive data. To survive in the quantum era, applications must migrate to quantum safe schemes, and preparing for this migration must already start now.
        In this talk, I will discuss our experience in integrating post-quantum crypto in enterprise applications. I’ll first describe quantum-safe TLS to secure the communication for PostgreSQL which is an open-source client-server database. Then I’ll continue with hash-based signature for digitally signing software packages with a focus on JarSigner which is an open-source for signing JAR files.

          description: |
            DNS is an fundamental Internet service that translates human-readable names to IP addresses. It is secured using DNSSEC, an extension that provides authentication and integrity through the use of cryptographic signatures. The inherent limitations of the DNS protocol lead to requirements for the signing algoritms, specifically in terms of key size and signature size. This leads to challenges when deploying post-quantum algoritms. SIDN Labs is setting up a testbed in which developers, network researchers, and DNS operators can experiment with PQC algorithms and DNSSEC. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate existing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms developers for use in DNS. In this presentation, we discuss some challenges and our progress on setting up a PQC-testbed for DNS.

      description: |
        After TCP/IP, X.509 is probably the most widely deployed technology in modern networking. Use cases of X.509 from the incredibly mainstream to the incredibly niche are as diverse as the Internet itself. This talk will classify different types of PKI deployments according to the types of challenges that they will face during PQ transition including discoverability of the crypto in use (cryptographic bill of materials CBOM), hardware lock-in, which, depending where it is in your network, leads to different types of migration challenges, and the security properties needing during the migration. We will then survey a suite of crypto discovery and transition tools discussing which migration types and security properties they address.

      title: Quantum-safe PKI for the German administration
      description: |
        The BSI is in control of the root certification authority of the public administration Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This PKI is an essential element of the German government’s business processes at federal, state and municipal levels. For instance, subscribers of this PKI receive a signed certificate corresponding to a cryptographic key pair, which is used for identification, encryption, the creation of electronic signatures and other applications.

        Currently, this PKI is based on RSA-4096. Hence, its security is threatened by the potential development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. In order to address this threat, a full migration to a PKI based on quantum-safe cryptographic primitives has to be carried out.

        Due to the variety of use-cases within this PKI, a number of technical requirements concerning performance, security and interoperability have to be taken into account in this migration. The goal of the talk is to discuss these requirements in detail and to present several concepts and possible solutions. In particular, we argue that a parallelized migration approach is essential in order to ensure constant availability of the system. Moreover, we discuss why standardized, stateful hash-based signature schemes such as XMSS or LMS are promising candidates for the root-CA-level in the PKI hierarchy.

          description: |
            Blockchain technology was created to make the storage of data or transactions more secure.  It has revolutionized the way we process transactions with improved security, efficiency, and transparency.  PKI is the security backbone of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of a blockchain network.  In the world of cryptocurrencies, private keys are used by the payer to sign and initiate a transaction.  It is also used by a validator to sign and assure the world that a transaction has been validated.  RSA and ECC are the most commonly used algorithms in the current PKI ecosystem.  It has been proven for over 40 years that the private key cannot be reverse engineered back from its public key even using the most powerful super computer today.  However, the rapid development of quantum computing is posing security threats to PKI because its excessive power can derive the private key back from its public key.  This breaks the backbone of blockchain security because transactions cannot be trusted anymore.  In this session we will cover quantum threats to blockchain.  We will also demonstrate some practical implementations of PQC that have been performed to convert an existing blockchain network to become quantum-safe.

          description: |
            Within the HAPKIDO project we aim to develop a roadmap for hybrid Quantum-Safe Public-Key Infrastructures. Next to TLS many other digital services rely on PKIs for their security; one important example is the electronic signatures on documents, which are standardized in PAdES and have legal value in many countries. One of the services which provides PAdES support is the european Digital Signing Service (DSS). To support the transition to quantum-safe PKIs we have created an extension for DSS, which allows users to use a hybrid certificate to sign and validate a PDF-document. In this presentation we will show our work and explain some of the decisions that we made in the process.
