DirectTrust is a healthcare focused non-profit membership organization (a 501c-6), a trust framework and a standards development organization. Our accredited members are issuers of credentials and operators of one of the largest healthcare information exchange networks in the US with over 2.7 million identity proofed endpoints at over 260,000 healthcare organizations and their affiliates. Healthcare information exchange, secure document signing and submission and general content commitment use-cases are within our scope. 

The organization is a recent marriage of two PKI based trust frameworks - SAFE Identity (originally SAFE BioPharma) and DirectTrust. Both are dedicated to enhancing the health of populations through secure, identity assured connections between healthcare trading partners protected by PKI. We maintain the policies of our trust framework through an open, transparent, consensus driven process with representation from issuers, service providers and relying parties.

DirectTrust Identity has applicability to healthcare in the US and in the EU through the operation of a bridge CA cross-certified with the US FPKI Federal Bridge and through credentials recognized as trusted by the European Medicines Agency. 

We advocate for the use of healthcare exchange standards like the Direct Standardâ„¢ and for the use of strong PKI based credentials with industry and US Federal agencies.
