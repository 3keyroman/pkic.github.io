**The need for certificates, identity management, access control, account authorisation and that’s all that we need to explain to you – it goes without saying. The incredible amount of work that this entails for some organisations? That’s certainly not self-evident.**

There’s really another way. Better, faster. Efficiently and easily. That’s what we at KeyTalk are committed to every day.
