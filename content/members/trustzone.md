**TRUSTZONE is Scandinavia’s largest SSL/TLS certificate supplier and a leading provider of scalable PKI and IoT solutions for encryption, authentication, and automated certificate lifecycle management.**

With a full suite of compatibility-optimized, fully scalable certificate products and solutions, we offer custom options for companies and organizations across industries.

Our options fit all company sizes — from small, one-person businesses and startups needing one or two SSL/TLS certificates to large international companies looking for full-scale, enterprise-grade solutions. 

We have more than 15 years’ experience with PKI, SSL/TLS, and certificate management. 3,000+ companies of all sizes have already trusted us with their certificates, and more than 80% of the Danish banking sector is protected by TRUSTZONE certificates.

## The story

Our founders Jacob and Henrik started TRUSTZONE more than 15 years ago. Up until then, they had grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of focus on customer service, quality, and innovation that they had both experienced firsthand.

## The mission

“We were young and slightly rebellious, and we were confident that the changes we had in mind would be in demand,” Jacob remembers.

Henrik adds: “Our ambition was to deliver PKI certificates and solutions in a much more innovative and customer-oriented way than what was generally the case at the time.

Mainly, we wanted to provide customers with the same products, but at a lower price and delivered with more quality, integrity, and service.”

## The launch

TRUSTZONE literally launched with a nosedive:

On the first day, while in the middle of a call to a potential customer, Henrik fell five feet through a hole in the floor — a relic from the time when our then-office, a former hangar in Copenhagen, was still used for renovating large hydroplanes (planes that can land directly on water). 

After a quick check-up at the hospital, Henrik, largely unscathed and unfazed, picked up where he had left off and went on to secure the deal that he had been working on when he fell.

## The journey so far

Since then, business has been less rocky: So far, we’ve outgrown four offices and issued far more than 100,000 certificates (and counting!) — all the while maintaining a close to 100% customer satisfaction and retention rate.

And the customer who was on the phone with Henrik when he fell through the hole in the floor? Still a valued TRUSTZONE customer to this day.
