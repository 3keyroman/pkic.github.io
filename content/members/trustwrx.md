TrustWrx is the first low-cost, hands-free enterprise-class security service to protect the networks, computers and smart devices in connected homes, small businesses and smart cities.

The entire network behind the secure gateway – including computers, laptops, smart thermostats, cameras, etc. – becomes invisible to prying eyes
and safe from the majority of threats and malware on the open Internet.

At the core of these cloud operations is a corporate-class security data center, based on the AWS cloud security suite, with highly advanced AI protections for email and web activity – delivered through TrustWrx’s patented secure communications.

## How does it work ?
Using the same simple consumer business model as smart thermostats and video doorbells, the TrustWrx secure gateway is bought for under $100 through major retailers or online, and simply plugged in at the home or business router.

Then, through a simple $10 per month online subscription service the sophisticated Internet security protections typical of only the largest corporations will be provided to the millions of marginally protected smart homes and small businesses.
