## Our culture

What does it mean **/ˈtrɪki/**, written ‘tricky’?
According to Cambridge Disctionary: “If a piece of work or problem is **tricky**, it is difficult to deal with and **needs careful attention or skill**.”
And this is exactly our approach.

- Technologies can be applied and operated in convenient, secure, and affordable way.​
- We do not have corporate hierarchy and our mantra is to be innovative and trusted in the things we do.
- We strongly support education, encouraging new knowledge in modern technologies, and sharing it among our team.
- Open, respectful, and trusted environment, where new ideas can thrive.
