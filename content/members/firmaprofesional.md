## We innovate to create secure and efficient transaction environments

We are a Trust Service Provider focussed on driving the digital competitiveness of organisations, covering identity and electronic signature services with the utmost legal validity. Moreover, our technology fully integrates into any platform or management system, guaranteeing its ease of use and availability.

We lead the trusted services market thanks to specialization and our ability to adapt to the specific needs of our customers. We operate as a Certification Authority approved by the Ministry of Economy and Company that issues digital certificates since 2001.

## What we do

- We issue individual and SSL digital certificates and business stamps.
- We provide certified technological solutions in the mobile phone (Firmamobile) or in the cloud (Firmacloud).
- We offer advanced certification services such as Corporate Digital Certification or a Qualified Time Stamp.
- We provide digital tools to facilitate biometric signature, electronic notifications, or electronic document management platforms, such as the signature holder.

## Background and shareholders
Firmaprofesional was set up in 2001 to cover the need to provide digital identities for professionals with an activity regulated by law. Its founding partners were Professional Associations, many of whom still form part of the shareholder structure.

Later, it reinvented itself to provide global services to Enterprises and Governments, thereby gaining new facilitating partners (Pimec, Icogam). With this impetus it was able to transform itself through the development or integration of new transformative technological solutions of its own trust services, as was the case of FirmaMobile, which resulted from its spin-off biid and FirmaCloud.
