The CA Security Council (CASC) is restructured and renamed to the **The Public Key Infrastructure Consortium (PKI Consortium)**, [membership-fees have been dropped](/join/) and the focus is being shifted to engagement and participation.
{{< /alert >}}

The PKI Consortium is comprised of leading Certificate Authorities that are committed to improve, create and collaborate on generic, industry or use-case specific policies, procedures, best practices, standards and tools that advance trust in assets and communication for everyone and everything using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as well as the security of the internet in general. By engaging with users, regulators, supervisory bodies and other interested or relying parties the consortium can address actual issues.
