## About us
The Public Key Infrastructure Consortium is comprised of leading Certificate Authorities that are committed to improve, create and collaborate on generic, industry or use-case specific policies, procedures, best practices, standards and tools that advance trust in assets and communication for everyone and everything using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as well as the security of the internet in general. By engaging with users, regulators, supervisory bodies and other interested or relying parties the consortium can address actual issues. 

## History
Created in 2013 as the **Certificate Authority Security Council (CASC)** or **CA Security Council** in short. The orginal purpose was a multi-vendor industry advocacy group to conduct research, promote Internet security standards and educate the public on Internet security issues. In 2021 the CASC was restructred and renamed to the **The Public Key Infrastructure Consortium**, member fees where dropped and the focus was shifted to engagement and participation.

## Members
Membership is currently available to publicly trusted Certificate Authorities, we are preparing to admit non CA members such as regulators, supervisory bodies and other interested parties. More information on how to become a member can be found at [here]({{< ref "/join.md" >}}).
