This latest iteration of the protocol for secure communications on the internet boasts several noteworthy improvements to both security and performance:
Security All cipher suites that do not provide forward secrecy have been eliminated from TLS 1.3. This is a very important security property, because without forward secrecy, if a serverâ€™s private key is compromised today, any previously-recorded conversations with that server dating back as long as the key was in use could be decrypted.</description></item></channel></rss>
